# Sushiswap and Liquidity Mining (LP Mining)

Sushiswap is the Uniswap fork brought new features like staking and governance to the exchange.

## Uniswap v2

At its core SushiSwap is just a Uniswap v2 fork. The contract code was copied 1:1 except for a few small differences. If you are curious about how Uniswap v2 works, check out my previous note [here](https://docs.page/ymart1n/study-notes/UniSwap_AMM_Study).

In particular SushiSwap is making use of liquidity pool tokens (LP tokens). Essentially LPs are for receiving [pro-rata](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pro-rata.asp) fees accrued in the pool. So you provide liquidity in a pool and get LP tokens minted in return. When the pool is now collecting fees over time, they are evenly distributed to all LP holders at the time of the trade. When you burn your LP tokens, you will receive your share of the pool + the collected fees.

Two changes to the Uniswap code where made by SushiSwap:

1. The function [setFeeTo](https://github.com/sushiswap/sushiswap/blob/64b758156da6f9bde1d8619f142946b005c1ba4a/contracts/uniswapv2/UniswapV2Factory.sol#L47-L50) was called in the deployment and the fee recipient was set to the SushiMaker contract (see below). Once the fee recipient is set, 1/6th of the LP supply growth due to the current trade are minted as protocol fee in the form of pool tokens. Since the trade fee on Uniswap is 0.3%, this will result in a 0.05% fee of every trade going towards the SushiMaker.
2. A migrator functionality was added (see SushiRoll below).

## SushiMaker

The [SushiMaker](https://github.com/sushiswap/sushiswap/blob/archieve/canary/contracts/SushiMaker.sol) will receive LP tokens from people trading on SushiSwap. It mostly consists of a `convert` function which does the following:

1. [Burn](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v2-core/blob/4dd59067c76dea4a0e8e4bfdda41877a6b16dedc/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol#L134) the LP tokens for the provided token pair. The result will be receiving proportional amounts of both `token0` and `token1`.
2. Inside `convertStep` trade both received tokens into SUSHI. This may require additional steps if there's no direct pool to trade into SUSHI.

```solidity SushiMaker.sol
// simplified version
function convert(address token0, address token1) external {
  UniV2Pair pair = UniV2Pair(factory.getPair(token0, token1));
  require(address(pair) != address(0), "Invalid pair");

  IERC20(address(pair)).safeTransfer(
      address(pair),
      pair.balanceOf(address(this))
  );

  (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) = pair.burn(address(this));

  if (token0 != pair.token0()) {
      (amount0, amount1) = (amount1, amount0);
  }

  _convertStep(token0, token1, amount0, amount1)
}
```

```solidity SushiMaker.sol
function _convertStep(
    address token0,
    address token1,
    uint256 amount0,
    uint256 amount1
) internal returns (uint256 sushiOut) {
    // Interactions
    if (token0 == token1) {
        uint256 amount = amount0.add(amount1);
        if (token0 == sushi) {
            IERC20(sushi).safeTransfer(bar, amount);
            sushiOut = amount;
        } else if (token0 == weth) {
            sushiOut = _toSUSHI(weth, amount);
        } else {
            address bridge = bridgeFor(token0);
            amount = _swap(token0, bridge, amount, address(this));
            sushiOut = _convertStep(bridge, bridge, amount, 0);
        }
    } else if (token0 == sushi) {
        // eg. SUSHI - ETH
        IERC20(sushi).safeTransfer(bar, amount0);
        sushiOut = _toSUSHI(token1, amount1).add(amount0);
    } else if (token1 == sushi) {
        // eg. USDT - SUSHI
        IERC20(sushi).safeTransfer(bar, amount1);
        sushiOut = _toSUSHI(token0, amount0).add(amount1);
    } else if (token0 == weth) {
        // eg. ETH - USDC
        sushiOut = _toSUSHI(
            weth,
            _swap(token1, weth, amount1, address(this)).add(amount0)
        );
    } else if (token1 == weth) {
        // eg. USDT - ETH
        sushiOut = _toSUSHI(
            weth,
            _swap(token0, weth, amount0, address(this)).add(amount1)
        );
    } else {
        // eg. MIC - USDT
        address bridge0 = bridgeFor(token0);
        address bridge1 = bridgeFor(token1);
        if (bridge0 == token1) {
            // eg. MIC - USDT - and bridgeFor(MIC) = USDT
            sushiOut = _convertStep(
                bridge0,
                token1,
                _swap(token0, bridge0, amount0, address(this)),
                amount1
            );
        } else if (bridge1 == token0) {
            // eg. WBTC - DSD - and bridgeFor(DSD) = WBTC
            sushiOut = _convertStep(
                token0,
                bridge1,
                amount0,
                _swap(token1, bridge1, amount1, address(this))
            );
        } else {
            sushiOut = _convertStep(
                bridge0,
                bridge1, // eg. USDT - DSD - and bridgeFor(DSD) = WBTC
                _swap(token0, bridge0, amount0, address(this)),
                _swap(token1, bridge1, amount1, address(this))
            );
        }
    }
}
```

The swap itself is performed on the SushiSwap pools itself. Let's see how this is done by examining the `_swap` function. For the trade we are using the low-level [Uniswap swap](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core/blob/4dd59067c76dea4a0e8e4bfdda41877a6b16dedc/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol#L159) function.

1. Get the current reserves of both tokens in the pool.
2. Compute the receiving amount from the reserves and token amount being swapped minus the fees. Calculation is based on the x \* y = k curve.

```solidity SushiMaker.sol
  function _swap(
      address fromToken,
      address toToken,
      uint256 amountIn,
      address to
  ) internal returns (uint256 amountOut) {
      IUniswapV2Pair pair =
          IUniswapV2Pair(factory.getPair(fromToken, toToken));
      require(address(pair) != address(0), "SushiMaker: Cannot convert");

      (uint256 reserve0, uint256 reserve1, ) = pair.getReserves();
      uint256 amountInWithFee = amountIn.mul(997);
      if (fromToken == pair.token0()) {
          amountOut =
              amountInWithFee.mul(reserve1) /
              reserve0.mul(1000).add(amountInWithFee);
          IERC20(fromToken).safeTransfer(address(pair), amountIn);
          pair.swap(0, amountOut, to, new bytes(0));
      } else {
          amountOut =
              amountInWithFee.mul(reserve0) /
              reserve1.mul(1000).add(amountInWithFee);
          IERC20(fromToken).safeTransfer(address(pair), amountIn);
          pair.swap(amountOut, 0, to, new bytes(0));
      }
  }
}
```

Once the amount out is computed, we can perform the swap. The last step to convert into SUSHI will always call the `_swap` function by passing the SUSHI token address and sending it to the bar:

```solidity
_swap(token, sushi, amountIn, bar)
```

That's it, now we converted all LP tokens into SUSHI. All converted SUSHI are sent to the SushiBar, see next contract.

---

## SushiBar

Inside the [SushiBar](https://github.com/sushiswap/sushiswap/blob/archieve/canary/contracts/SushiBar.sol) people can enter with SUSHI, receive xSUSHI and later leave with even more SUSHI. Remember that all SUSHI from the SushiMaker are sent here. So over time the bar will accumulate more and more SUSHI.

Who will receive this SUSHI?

Anyone who entered the bar. For entering a user receives xSUSHI which are kind of like the LP tokens for Uniswap. They represent ownership of the SUSHI token in the bar.

The amount of xSUSHI you receive is your transferred SUSHI \* total xSUSHI supply / current balance of SUSHI. So if you send 10 SUSHI to the bar which already has 100 SUSHI in it and 200 xSUSHI total supply, you will receive 10 \* 200 / 100 = 20 xSUSHI.

```solidity SushiBar.sol
// Enter the bar. Pay some SUSHIs. Earn some shares.
// Locks Sushi and mints xSushi
function enter(uint256 _amount) public {
    // Gets the amount of Sushi locked in the contract
    uint256 totalSushi = sushi.balanceOf(address(this));
    // Gets the amount of xSushi in existence
    uint256 totalShares = totalSupply();
    // If no xSushi exists, mint it 1:1 to the amount put in
    if (totalShares == 0 || totalSushi == 0) {
        _mint(msg.sender, _amount);
    }
    // Calculate and mint the amount of xSushi the Sushi is worth. The ratio will change overtime, as xSushi is burned/minted and Sushi deposited + gained from fees / withdrawn.
    else {
        uint256 what = _amount.mul(totalShares).div(totalSushi);
        _mint(msg.sender, what);
    }
    // Lock the Sushi in the contract
    sushi.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
}
```

The above function can be simplified to the following:

```solidity
function enter(uint256 _amount) external {
    uint256 totalSushi = sushi.balanceOf(address(this));
    uint256 totalShares = totalSupply();

    uint256 mintAmount =
        totalShares == 0 || totalSushi == 0
        ? _amount
        : _amount.mul(totalShares).div(totalSushi);

    _mint(msg.sender, mintAmount);
    sushi.transferFrom(
      msg.sender,
      address(this),
      _amount
    );
}
```

Now when you leave again, you get your equal share of SUSHI back. This will be at the minimum what you paid in, but considering the bar will accumulate SUSHI over time, it should be more than what you put originally in.

The amount of SUSHI you receive is your transferred xSUSHI \* current balance of SUSHI / total xSUSHI supply. So if you send 20 xSUSHI to the bar which has 100 SUSHI in it and 200 xSUSHI total supply, you will receive 20 \* 100 / 200 = 10 SUSHI.

```solidity SushiBar.sol
// Leave the bar. Claim back your SUSHIs.
// Unlocks the staked + gained Sushi and burns xSushi
function leave(uint256 _share) public {
    // Gets the amount of xSushi in existence
    uint256 totalShares = totalSupply();
    // Calculates the amount of Sushi the xSushi is worth
    uint256 what = _share
        .mul(sushi.balanceOf(address(this)))
        .div(totalShares);
    _burn(msg.sender, _share);
    sushi.transfer(msg.sender, what);
}
```

## SushiToken

Of course you have the [SUSHI token contract](https://github.com/sushiswap/sushiswap/blob/archieve/canary/contracts/SushiToken.sol) itself. There's nothing special to it other than being a regular ERC-20 with delegation functionality identical to the [COMP token](https://soliditydeveloper.com/comp-governance). The mentioned [Timelock](https://github.com/sushiswap/sushiswap/blob/archieve/canary/contracts/governance/Timelock.sol) contract is also included in SushiSwap.

The token allows delegating your voting power to some other trusted address. This address can then vote with increased power. Any time you may choose to re-delegate somewhere else.

---

## SushiRoll (Migrator)

In the [SushiRoll](https://github.com/sushiswap/sushiswap/blob/archieve/canary/contracts/SushiRoll.sol) contract a migrator is provided, so people can easily move liquidity from Uniswap to SushiSwap.

With the migrate function, you essentially

1. Remove liquidity from Uniswap.
2. Add liquidity in SushiSwap.

Any potential leftover tokens from the token pair will be returned to the user.

```solidity SushiRoll.sol
function removeLiquidity(
    address tokenA,
    address tokenB,
    uint256 liquidity,
    uint256 amountAMin,
    uint256 amountBMin,
    uint256 deadline
) internal returns (uint256 amountA, uint256 amountB) {
    IUniswapV2Pair pair = IUniswapV2Pair(pairForOldRouter(tokenA, tokenB));
    pair.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(pair), liquidity);
    (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) = pair.burn(address(this));
    (address token0,) = UniswapV2Library.sortTokens(tokenA, tokenB);
    (amountA, amountB) = tokenA == token0 ? (amount0, amount1) : (amount1, amount0);
    require(amountA >= amountAMin, 'SushiRoll: INSUFFICIENT_A_AMOUNT');
    require(amountB >= amountBMin, 'SushiRoll: INSUFFICIENT_B_AMOUNT');
}

function addLiquidity(
    address tokenA,
    address tokenB,
    uint256 amountADesired,
    uint256 amountBDesired
) internal returns (uint amountA, uint amountB) {
    (amountA, amountB) = _addLiquidity(tokenA, tokenB, amountADesired, amountBDesired);
    address pair = UniswapV2Library.pairFor(router.factory(), tokenA, tokenB);
    IERC20(tokenA).safeTransfer(pair, amountA);
    IERC20(tokenB).safeTransfer(pair, amountB);
    IUniswapV2Pair(pair).mint(msg.sender);
}

// msg.sender should have approved 'liquidity' amount of LP token of 'tokenA' and 'tokenB'
function migrate(
    address tokenA,
    address tokenB,
    uint256 liquidity,
    uint256 amountAMin,
    uint256 amountBMin,
    uint256 deadline
) public {
    require(deadline >= block.timestamp, 'SushiSwap: EXPIRED');

    // Remove liquidity from the old router with permit
    (uint256 amountA, uint256 amountB) = removeLiquidity(
        tokenA,
        tokenB,
        liquidity,
        amountAMin,
        amountBMin,
        deadline
    );

    // Add liquidity to the new router
    (uint256 pooledAmountA, uint256 pooledAmountB) = addLiquidity(tokenA, tokenB, amountA, amountB);

    // Send remaining tokens to msg.sender
    if (amountA > pooledAmountA) {
        IERC20(tokenA).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amountA - pooledAmountA);
    }
    if (amountB > pooledAmountB) {
        IERC20(tokenB).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amountB - pooledAmountB);
    }
}
```

As you can see in the `removeLiquidity` and `addLiquidity` method above, Solidity function can have an [optional return statement](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/solidity/solidity_functions.htm).

## MasterChef

The [MasterChef](https://github.com/sushiswap/sushiswap/blob/archieve/canary/contracts/MasterChefV2.sol) enables the minting of new SUSHI token. It's the only way that SUSHI tokens are created. This is possible by staking LP tokens inside the MasterChef. The MasterChef is controlled by the owner which originally used to be Chef Nomi, but is since controlled by a 9 person [multi-sig wallet](https://blog.bitstamp.net/post/what-is-a-multisig-wallet/).

Eventually the plan is to move control of the MasterChef to governance. The owner has the power to control the allocations points from pools. What this means is the higher the allocation points of a liquidity pool, the more SUSHI one receives for staking its LP tokens. In the future this might create powerful control to create incentives for participating in special liquidity pools.

The owner can control pool allocations via the `add` function:

```solidity MasterChefV2.sol
/// @notice Add a new LP to the pool. Can only be called by the owner.
/// DO NOT add the same LP token more than once. Rewards will be messed up if you do.
/// @param allocPoint AP of the new pool.
/// @param _lpToken Address of the LP ERC-20 token.
/// @param _rewarder Address of the rewarder delegate.
function add(uint256 allocPoint, IERC20 _lpToken, IRewarder _rewarder) public onlyOwner {
    uint256 lastRewardBlock = block.number;
    totalAllocPoint = totalAllocPoint.add(allocPoint);
    lpToken.push(_lpToken);
    rewarder.push(_rewarder);

    poolInfo.push(PoolInfo({
        allocPoint: allocPoint.to64(),
        lastRewardBlock: lastRewardBlock.to64(),
        accSushiPerShare: 0
    }));
    emit LogPoolAddition(lpToken.length.sub(1), allocPoint, _lpToken, _rewarder);
}
```

### updatePool

Ongoing pools can be updated and then mint SUSHI to the people staking the LP tokens using `updatePool`.

The newly minted SUSHI amount per pool depends on the passed blocks since the last update and the set allocation points for the pool. (plus some extra multiplier left out for simplicity in the example on the right)

The calculated sushiReward is then distributed in 10% towards the dev address and the other 90% towards the pool LP stakers.

```solidity MasterChefV2.sol
/// @notice Update reward variables of the given pool.
/// @param pid The index of the pool. See `poolInfo`.
/// @return pool Returns the pool that was updated.
function updatePool(uint256 pid) public returns (PoolInfo memory pool) {
    pool = poolInfo[pid];
    if (block.number > pool.lastRewardBlock) {
        uint256 lpSupply = lpToken[pid].balanceOf(address(this));
        if (lpSupply > 0) {
            uint256 blocks = block.number.sub(pool.lastRewardBlock);
            uint256 sushiReward = blocks.mul(sushiPerBlock()).mul(pool.allocPoint) / totalAllocPoint;
            pool.accSushiPerShare = pool.accSushiPerShare.add((sushiReward.mul(ACC_SUSHI_PRECISION) / lpSupply).to128());
        }
        pool.lastRewardBlock = block.number.to64();
        poolInfo[pid] = pool;
        emit LogUpdatePool(pid, pool.lastRewardBlock, lpSupply, pool.accSushiPerShare);
    }
}
```

### deposit

Using the deposit function users can stake their LP tokens for the provided pool. This will put the user's LP token into the MasterChef contract.

```solidity MasterChefV2.sol
/// @notice Deposit LP tokens to MCV2 for SUSHI allocation.
/// @param pid The index of the pool. See `poolInfo`.
/// @param amount LP token amount to deposit.
/// @param to The receiver of `amount` deposit benefit.
function deposit(uint256 pid, uint256 amount, address to) public {
    PoolInfo memory pool = updatePool(pid);
    UserInfo storage user = userInfo[pid][to];

    // Effects
    user.amount = user.amount.add(amount);
    user.rewardDebt = user.rewardDebt.add(int256(amount.mul(pool.accSushiPerShare) / ACC_SUSHI_PRECISION));

    // Interactions
    IRewarder _rewarder = rewarder[pid];
    if (address(_rewarder) != address(0)) {
        _rewarder.onSushiReward(pid, to, to, 0, user.amount);
    }

    lpToken[pid].safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);

    emit Deposit(msg.sender, pid, amount, to);
}
```

### withdraw

Using the withdraw function users can unstake their LP tokens for the provided pool. In return they will

1. Receive their original LP tokens
2. Get their share of newly minted SUSHI tokens

```solidity MasterChefV2.sol
/// @notice Withdraw LP tokens from MCV2.
/// @param pid The index of the pool. See `poolInfo`.
/// @param amount LP token amount to withdraw.
/// @param to Receiver of the LP tokens.
function withdraw(uint256 pid, uint256 amount, address to) public {
    PoolInfo memory pool = updatePool(pid);
    UserInfo storage user = userInfo[pid][msg.sender];

    // Effects
    user.rewardDebt = user.rewardDebt.sub(int256(amount.mul(pool.accSushiPerShare) / ACC_SUSHI_PRECISION));
    user.amount = user.amount.sub(amount);

    // Interactions
    IRewarder _rewarder = rewarder[pid];
    if (address(_rewarder) != address(0)) {
        _rewarder.onSushiReward(pid, msg.sender, to, 0, user.amount);
    }

    lpToken[pid].safeTransfer(to, amount);

    emit Withdraw(msg.sender, pid, amount, to);
}
```

## MiniChef

The [MiniChef contract](https://github.com/sushiswap/sushiswap/blob/archieve/canary/contracts/MiniChefV2.sol) plays the same role as the MasterChef contract does, with the main exception being that they are deployed across L2's, whereas MasterChef is deployed on the Ethereum mainnet. Check out the docs [here](https://docs.sushi.com/docs/Developers/Sushiswap/MiniChef).

## SushiMakerKashi

[SushiMakerKashi](https://github.com/sushiswap/sushiswap/blob/archieve/canary/contracts/SushiMakerKashi.sol) handles "serving up" rewards for xSUSHI holders by trading tokens collected from Kashi fees for SUSHI. Check out the docs [here](https://docs.sushi.com/docs/Developers/Sushiswap/SushiMakerKashi).

### What is Kashi?

Kashi is a lending and margin trading platform, built on the BentoBox, that allows for anyone to create customized and gas-efficient markets for lending, borrowing, and collateralizing a variety of DeFi tokens, stable coins, and synthetic assets. Kashi's broad diversity of tokens is supported through the use of a unique isolated market framework. Unlike traditional DeFi money markets where high-risk assets can introduce risk to the entire protocol, in Kashi each market is entirely separate (similar to the SushiSwap DEX), meaning the risk of assets within one lending market has no effect over the risk of another lending market.

Traditional lending projects have permitted users to add liquidity into a pool-based system. In these systems, if one of the assets were to drop in price faster than liquidators could react, every user and every asset would be negatively impacted. In this sense, the total risk of pool-based platforms is determined largely by the riskiest asset listed on the platform. This risk increases with every extra asset that is added, leading to a very limited choice in assets on most platforms. Kashi's unique design enables a new kind of lending and borrowing. The ability to isolate risks into individual lending markets means that Kashi can permit users to add any token.

In addition, isolating the risks of the different lending markets enables users to achieve leverage in one click, without ever leaving the platform. In the past, users seeking leverage on an asset through direct lending and borrowing would have had to borrow on one platform in order to lend on another, and repeat. Because Kashi separates markets into pairs, lending and borrowing into the same market are composable, which means that Kashi can automate leverage in a single click.

## BentoBox

The [BentoBox](https://github.com/sushiswap/sushiswap/blob/archieve/canary/contracts/bentobox/BentoBoxV1.sol) is a vault for tokens. The stored tokens can be flashloaned or used in strategies - the yield from this will go to the token depositors.
